* First-class account management 
* Free access to our powerful publisher tools

= Q. How can I calculate what revenue I could earn from using Skimlinks? =

There are a huge number of factors influencing the potential to earn revenue from links on your blog, including the volume of users and their profile, the type of content, seasonality and the amount of other advertising you have on your site. Years of experience and lots of happy customers tell us that Skimlinks has a real impact on publishers businesses but why not give Skimlinks a try and see what it can do for you!
Q. What costs are involved in signing-up to Skimlinks? 
It's completely free to sign-up to Skimlinks. Once approved as a Skimlinks' publisher you get full access to our suite of reports and tools.


= Q. Will I earn the same amount I would earn if I created the affiliate links myself? =

Because of our scale we can negotiate the very best commissions for our publishers, which means you can earn up to 110% of what you would have earned if you managed your affiliate links program yourself.  Skimlinks retains 25% of the commission payment from the merchant, and the rest we pay to you.


= Q. Which Merchants do you work with? =
When you join the Skimlinks, you can access all of the reporting capabilities in the publisher interface, including the Merchant look-up feature to see the 8,000+ retailers in the Skimlinks network.  We actively monitor where your users are clicking and approach merchants on your behalf to make sure we offer a broad and interesting range of retailer programs.


= Q. Is Skimlinks visible to my blog readers? =
Skimlinks lets the normal link appear, and turns it into an affiliate link only when the user clicks through, so there is no visible difference to the user. This gives users more trust in your site, and increases the likelihood they will click on the link.


= Q. What happens in the event that the Skimlinks' service is unavailable? =
The Skimlinks technology is monitored 24/7, and is fully redundant. If, in the unlikely event, our technology stops working, links will not be affiliated for a temporary period but the user experience is not affected.  

= Q. I've upgraded to Version 1.2+ and links have started appearing on phrases in my content. Why is this? =
There is nothing to worry about! When you upgraded to Version 1.2, your site is now using the latest version of our technology and this means that the current product settings on the Installation page in your Skimlinks Publisher Interface have taken effect. If you have SkimWords enabled on that page, this is why links are being added to your content. You can change these settings to suit your needs in your [Publisher Interface](https://skimlinks.com/login/settings) at anytime. You can read more about SkimWords, Skimlinks’ in-text monetization product, on [our website](http://skimlinks.com/skimwords).
